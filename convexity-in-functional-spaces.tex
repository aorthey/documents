\title{Convexity Constraints in Optimization over Functional Spaces}
\author{Andreas Orthey}
\date{}
\maketitle

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Let $\btau \in \F = C([0,1],X)$ with $\F$ being an infinite dimensional
functional space containing all continuous functions from $[0,1]$ to a space
$X$. We can represent $\F$ by an orthonormal basis of an infinite number of
basis functions $\{f_1,f_2,\cdots\}$. Any function $\btau$ in $\F$ can then be
written as a linear combination of basis functions as

\begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
                \btau(t) &= \sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty w_k f_k(t)
        \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

whereby $w_k$ are called the coefficients of the basis functions. Optimization
over $\F$ can now be done by optimizing over the linear coefficients $w_k$,
corresponding to a linear program.

\begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
                &\underset{\{w_1,w_2,\cdots\}}{\text{optimize }}&&
                \btau = \sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty w_k f_k(t)\\
                %&\text{subject to }&& a_i^T y + R\|a_i\|_2 \leq b_i\\
                %&&& R \geq 0
        \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Let us approximate this linear program by using only a finite number of basis
function, corresponding to a subspace of $\F$. This corresponds to a loss of
completeness. However, since high frequency functions
are often undesirable in motion planning, this approximation will actually be
almost not noticeable. Let us choose a $K\gg0$ such that

\begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
                &\underset{\{w_1,\cdots,w_K\}}{\text{optimize }}&&
                \tau = \sum\limits_{k=0}^K w_k f_k(t)\\
                %&\text{subject to }&& a_i^T y + R\|a_i\|_2 \leq b_i\\
                %&&& R \geq 0
        \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

This convex (linear) program will be our (approximate) representation of the functional
space $\F$.

\section{Classical Convex Constraints}
We can now apply any convex constraints on the functional space, so
that we preserve convexity of our optimization procedure. A good overview is
given by \cite{boyd}. We will try to list here all known convex constraints, whereby
\begin{itemize}
        \item LEC = Linear Equality Constraint
        \item LIC = Linear Inequality Constraint
        \item QEC = Quadratic Equality Constraint
        \item QIC = Quadratic Inequality Constraint
        \item CEC = Convex Equality Constraint
        \item CIC = Convex Inequality Constraint
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Interpolation Condition (LEC)}
At point $t_i$, we like the function $\tau$ to have the value $z_i$,
corresponding for example to a waypoint at $z_i$. 
\begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
                \boxed{\tau(t_i) = z_i, \hspace{0.5cm}i=1,\cdots,m}
        \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
this is a LEC on the functional space.

\subsection{Neighborhood Constraint (LIC)}

We can also require the
function to be in an $\epsilon$-neighborhood of the waypoint at point $t_i$ as:
\begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
                \boxed{\|\tau(t_i) - z_i\|_2 \leq \eps \hspace{0.5cm}i=1,\cdots,m}
        \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Polytope Constraint (LIC)}
Going even further, we can restrict the position of $\tau$ at point $t_i$ to any
convex polytope $P=\{x| Ax\leq b\}$ as
\begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
                \boxed{A\tau(t_i) \leq b \hspace{0.5cm}i=1,\cdots,m}
        \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Lipschitz Constraint (LIC)}
\begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
                \boxed{\|\tau(t_j)-\tau(t_k)\| \leq L\|t_j-t_k\| \hspace{0.5cm}i=1,\cdots,m}
        \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\newpage
\section{Convex Derivative Constraints}

Let us assume that $\F$ is actually $\C^1$, contains only functions which are
differentiable. Given a point $t_i$, the derivative of $\tau$ is given by

\begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
                \dfrac{d}{dt}\tau(t) = \sum\limits_{k=0}^K w_k \dfrac{d}{dt} f_k(t)
        \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
which is again a linear function of x. We can therefore apply any constraints
which we applied to $\tau$ also to its derivative $\dtau$.


\subsection{Maximum Gradient Norm (QIC)}
If we like to constraint the maximum gradient of $\tau$ (corresponding to a
maximum speed), we can do this via a QIC
\begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
                \boxed{\|\dtau(t_i)\| \leq M}
        \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Monotonity (LIC)}

If we like our function to be increasing we can restrict the derivative to the
positive halfspace
\begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
                \boxed{\tau(t_i) \geq 0 \hspace{0.5cm}i=1,\cdots,m}
        \end{aligned}
\end{equation}


\section{Combination Constraints}

\subsection{Circle on Polygonal Surface Constraint}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\scalebox{0.6}{\input{figure-circle-on-polytope-surface.tex}}
\end{figure}

Let a polytope be given by $P =\{x\in R^n|a_k x \leq b_k, k=1,\cdots,D\}$,
non-empty, bounded. Given a surface $p$ of this polytope, we can construct a
convex equation to determine if a point on the surface $p$ has a circle of radius $R$, which is fully contained in the surface element $p$. 

\begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
                        a_k^T x + R a_k^T a_k'&\leq b_k,&&\scalebox{0.9}{$i=\{1,\cdots,p-1,p+1,\cdots,T\}$}\\
                        a_p^Tx &= b_p\\
        \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
        whereby $R$ is the radius of the circle, $x$ the center, $a_p$ is the surface normal of the element $p$, and $a_k'$ is the
        orthogonal projection onto the hyperplane of $a_p$, i.e. $a_k' = a_k -
        (a_k^Ta_p)a_p$. %Visualized in Fig. \ref{fig:circleonsurface}. 
        This could correspond to the (circular) foot of a humanoid robot stepping on a box or another surface element. If our trajectory is actually a trajectory for a foot, we might want to restrict the whole foot to this surface element. The corresponding constraint on our trajectory would be


\begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
        \boxed{A \tau(t_i) \leq b - \eps \diag (A^T A')}
        \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
whereby we have $A=\{a_1,\cdots,a_D\}$ and $A'=\{a'_1,\cdots,a'_D\}$ with $a'_k = a_k - (a_k^Ta_p)a_p$
